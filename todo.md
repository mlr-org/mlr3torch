All the learner implementations: 

* [ ] LearnerClassifMLP
* [ ] Image Learners: They are so similar, we might create them all programmatically with one help page.

# Other


**Important**

* [ ] Add the learners etc. for regression
* [ ] Cloning of trained networks (requires new torch version)
* [ ] Reproducibility: Add the cuda seed resetting
* [ ] param_set$get_values(tags = "train") expects all parameters to be tagged with "train" --> maybe this is currently a bug
* [ ] tiny_imagenet --> We can create construction argument download and then as.data.table.DictionaryTasks works (look at its code for information)
* [ ] Implement bundling
* [ ] Utility functions for save_torch_learner and load_torch_learner, this should also be called in callback checkpoint

**Missing stuff**

* [ ] The image learners
* [ ] Some image tasks
* [ ] The tabnet learner (we then only have the mlp learner and tabnet but should be enough for the beginning)

**Refactors**

* [ ] We should structure the parameters better with tags to define which function gets what 
* [ ] Add the learners from the attic and all image learners
* [ ] Use meta device in tests wherever possible to make tests run as fast as possible.
* [ ] ensure that caching does what we want the caching to do (tiny imagenet)
* [ ] ensure proper use of tags in e.g.  `param_set$get_values(tags = "train")`
* [ ] Autotest should check that all parameters are tagged with train and predict etc. Generally determine usage of tags.
* [ ] Run some tests on gpu
* [x] Rename Debug Torch Learner to featureless and export

**Other**
* [ ] Check that defaults and initial values are correctly used everywhere
* [ ] Is withr important anyway? If yes, then remove the with_seed function, otherwise remove withr from imports
* [ ] Reset the torch seed after ending the `$train()` call of the learner.
* [ ] Check which versions of the packages we actually require
* [ ] Check which man files are actually used and remove the rest




* [ ] Implement the torch methods with explicit parameters in the function so that we can better check whether a parameter 
from paramset_torchlearner is actually doing something

**Consistency**
* [ ] Check that all the mlr3torch_activations are simple and maybe rename to activations_simple. 
Also add tests or sth. (For learners that allow to set the activation function but expect it to be a scalar). 

**Performance**


* [ ] Setup benchmark scripts that also run on GPU and run them at least once

**Test Coverage**
* Parameters must have default or tag required (?)
* [ ] Check that mlr_pipeops can still be converted to dict
* [ ] autotest for torch learner should ensure that optimizer and loss can be set in construction
* [ ] Test that the defaults of the activation functions are correctly implemented
* [ ] Properly refactor the test helpers (classes and modules etc) in other files and dont keep them in the tests.
* [ ] Use the tests from mlr3pipelines for all the pipeops
* [ ] Test the updated versions of the TorchWrapper
* [ ] Deep clones of torch modules: 
-> the function that checks for deep clones needs to skip some torch-specific stuff, e.g. the attribute "module" 
for nn modules, or "Optimizer" for optim_adam etc.
* [ ] Test that the default values of the pipeops are correctly documented
* Write expect_learner_torch that checks all the properties a torch learner has to satisfy
* [ ] Meta tests for the functions / objects created for the tests (like PipeOpTorchDebug)
* [ ] Parameter tests for callbacks

**Cosmetic**
* [x] Better printer for ModelDescriptor (see whether loss is configured e.g.)
* [x] Rename LearnerClassifTorchAbstract to LearnerClassifTorch and LearnerClassifTorch to LearnerClassifTorchModule

**Documentation**

* [ ] Define the @family tags somewhere and then annotate everything correctly
* [ ] Use the `tags` constrctor argument from PipeOps
* [ ] Check that objects have the correct families in the documentation.
* [ ] Add tests for documentation, i.e. that all the required sections are present
* [ ] Write test that all construction arguments are documented.
* [ ] Properly document that the classifiers must return the scores and no the probabilities
* Add examples for all PipeOps (maybe a template for PipeOpTorch?)
*   It must be documented how the output names are generated, when outputs of non-terminal nodes are used
    in "output_map" ("output_<id>_output.<channel>")
* [ ] Make the paramset torch leaner template a roxygen function, it should be directly seen for every learner (?).

In the future (soon): 

* [ ] Create {classif, regr}.torch_module learner to create custom torch learners (classif.torch did not really work because of the dataloader)
* [ ] Maybe it should be possible to easily overwrite the dataloader for a learner (?) 
* [ ] Implement early stopping and all other parameters from paramset torchlearner. 

**In the future**

* [ ] general method for freezing and unfreezing parameters.
* [ ] support the `weights` property for the learners.
* [ ] Calling `benchmark()` and evaluate the jobs on different GPUs?
* [ ] Check overhead on cpu and small batch sizes


**Optimization**

* [ ] Minimize the time the tests run!
  (utilize the fetureless torch learner as much as possible, should probbably extend it to all feature types)
