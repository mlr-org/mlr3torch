#' @title Represent a Model with Meta-Info
#'
#' @description
#' Represents a *model*; possibly a complete model, possibly one in the process of being built up.
#'
#' This model takes input tensors of shapes `shapes_in` and
#' pipes them through `graph`. Input shapes get mapped to input channels of `graph`.
#' Output shapes are named by the output channels of `graph`; it is also possible
#' to represent no-ops on tensors, in which case names of input and output should be identical.
#'
#' `ModelDescriptor` objects typically represent partial models being built up, in which case the `.pointer` slot
#' indicates a specific point in the graph that produces a tensor of shape `.pointer_shape`, on which the graph should
#' be extended.
#' It is allowed for the `graph` in this structure to be modified by-reference in different parts of the code.
#' However, these modifications may never add edges with elements of the `Graph` as destination. In particular, no
#' element of `graph$input` may be removed by reference, e.g. by adding an edge to the `Graph` that has the input
#' channel of a `PipeOp` that was previously without parent as its destination.
#'
#' In most cases it is better to create a specific `ModelDescriptor` by training a [`Graph`] consisting (mostly) of
#' operators [`PipeOpTorchIngress`], [`PipeOpTorch`], [`PipeOpTorchLoss`], [`PipeOpTorchOptimizer`], and
#' [`PipeOpTorchCallbacks`].
#'
#' A `ModelDescriptor` can be converted to a [`nn_graph`] via [`model_descriptor_to_module`].
#'
#' @param graph ([`Graph`][mlr3pipelines::Graph])\cr
#'   `Graph` of [`PipeOpModule`] and [`PipeOpNOP`] operators.
#' @param ingress (uniquely named `list` of `TorchIngressToken`)\cr
#'   List of inputs that go into `graph`. Names of this must be a subset of `graph$input$name`.
#' @param task ([`Task`][mlr3::Task])\cr
#'   (Training)-Task for which the model is being built. May be necessary for for some aspects of what loss to use etc.
#' @param optimizer ([`TorchOptimizer`] | `NULL`)\cr
#'   Additional info: what optimizer to use.
#' @param loss ([`TorchLoss`] | `NULL`)\cr
#'   Additional info: what loss to use.
#' @param callbacks (A `list` of [`CallbackSet`] or `NULL`)\cr
#'   Additional info: what callbacks to use.
#' @param .pointer (`character(2)` | `NULL`)\cr
#'   Indicating an element on which a model is. Points to an output channel within `graph`:
#'   Element 1 is the `PipeOp`'s id and element 2 is that `PipeOp`'s output channel.
#' @param .pointer_shape (`integer` | `NULL`)\cr
#'   Shape of the output indicated by `.pointer`.

#' @title Union of ModelDescriptors
#'
#' @description
#' This is a mostly internal function that is used in [`PipeOpTorch`]s with multiple input channels.
#'
#' It creates the union of multiple [`ModelDescriptor`]s:
#'
#' * `graph`s are combinded (if they are not identical to begin with). The first entry's `graph` is modified by
#'    reference.
#' * `PipeOp`s with the same ID must be identical. No new input edges may be added to `PipeOp`s.
#' * Drops `.pointer` / `.pointer_shape` entries.
#' * The new task is the [feature union][PipeOpFeatureUnion] of the two incoming tasks.
#' * The `optimizer` and `loss` of both [`ModelDescriptor`]s must be identical.
#' * Ingress tokens and callbacks are merged, where objects with the same `"id"` must be identical.
#'
#' @details
#' The requirement that no new input edgedes may be added to `PipeOp`s  is not theoretically necessary, but since
#' we assume that ModelDescriptor is being built from beginning to end (i.e. `PipeOp`s never get new ancestors) we
#' can make this assumption and simplify things. Otherwise we'd need to treat "..."-inputs special.)
