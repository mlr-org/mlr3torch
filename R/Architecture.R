#' @title Reduce an Architecture to Layers (nn_modules)
#' @description A Architecture contains builders (nodes) and edges that indicate how the data will
#' flow through the layers that are constructed by the builders.
#' This function builds all the layers.
#' For that the ids of the grpah need to be topologically sorted and then one has to loop over the
#' topologically sorted layers and call the build function. The outputs of each layer are safed
#' until all the direct children of the node are built.
#'
#' This structure is essentially identical to the network_forward function only that we here
#' additionally call the build function and also that the task is passe == idxd instead of the actual
#' network input as obtained from the dataloader.
#'
#' @param architecture (mlr3torch::Architecture) The architecture that is being build from the task.
#' @param task (mlr3::Task) The task for which to build the architecture.
#' @param input (torch::Tensor) The input tensor. If NULL the output of the data-loader that is
#' generated from the task is used. (E.g. used when reducing a block)
