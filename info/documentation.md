Templates  + R6 + roxygen has a lot of issues.
Sometimes, templates work, sometimes they don't and it is not clear why.
For this reason, do NOT CHANGE the template layout without good reason.

Especially the @examples and @params tags created problems, such as

"1: [TEMPLATE:20] @examples Cannot find matching R6 method"

There are different issues in GitHub:
* https://github.com/r-lib/roxygen2/issues/1435
* https://github.com/r-lib/roxygen2/issues/1345 (mine)
