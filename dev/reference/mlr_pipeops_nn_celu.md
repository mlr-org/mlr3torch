# CELU Activation Function

Applies element-wise, \\CELU(x) = max(0,x) + min(0, \alpha \* (exp(x
\alpha) - 1))\\.

## nn_module

Calls
[`torch::nn_celu()`](https://torch.mlverse.org/docs/reference/nn_celu.html)
when trained.

## Parameters

- `alpha` :: `numeric(1)`  
  The alpha value for the ELU formulation. Default: 1.0

- `inplace` :: `logical(1)`  
  Whether to do the operation in-place. Default: `FALSE`.

## Input and Output Channels

One input channel called `"input"` and one output channel called
`"output"`. For an explanation see
[`PipeOpTorch`](https://mlr3torch.mlr-org.com/dev/reference/mlr_pipeops_torch.md).

## State

The state is the value calculated by the public method `$shapes_out()`.

### Method `new()`

Creates a new instance of this
[R6](https://r6.r-lib.org/reference/R6Class.html) class.

#### Usage

    PipeOpTorchCELU$new(id = "nn_celu", param_vals = list())

#### Arguments

- `id`:

  (`character(1)`)  
  Identifier of the resulting object.

- `param_vals`:

  ([`list()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/list.html))  
  List of hyperparameter settings, overwriting the hyperparameter
  settings that would otherwise be set during construction.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Method `clone()`

The objects of this class are cloneable with this method.

#### Usage

    PipeOpTorchCELU$clone(deep = FALSE)

#### Arguments

- `deep`:

  Whether to make a deep clone.
