# 3D Batch Normalization

Applies Batch Normalization for each channel across a batch of data.

## nn_module

Calls
[`torch::nn_batch_norm3d()`](https://torch.mlverse.org/docs/reference/nn_batch_norm3d.html).
The parameter `num_features` is inferred as the second dimension of the
input shape.

## Input and Output Channels

One input channel called `"input"` and one output channel called
`"output"`. For an explanation see
[`PipeOpTorch`](https://mlr3torch.mlr-org.com/reference/mlr_pipeops_torch.md).

## State

The state is the value calculated by the public method `$shapes_out()`.

## Parameters

- `eps` :: `numeric(1)`  
  A value added to the denominator for numerical stability. Default:
  `1e-5`.

- `momentum` :: `numeric(1)`  
  The value used for the running_mean and running_var computation. Can
  be set to `NULL` for cumulative moving average (i.e. simple average).
  Default: 0.1

- `affine` :: `logical(1)`  
  a boolean value that when set to `TRUE`, this module has learnable
  affine parameters. Default: `TRUE`

- `track_running_stats` :: `logical(1)`  
  a boolean value that when set to `TRUE`, this module tracks the
  running mean and variance, and when set to `FALSE`, this module does
  not track such statistics and always uses batch statistics in both
  training and eval modes. Default: `TRUE`
