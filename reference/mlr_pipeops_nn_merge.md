# Merge Operation

Base class for merge operations such as addition
([`PipeOpTorchMergeSum`](https://mlr3torch.mlr-org.com/reference/mlr_pipeops_nn_merge_sum.md)),
multiplication
([`PipeOpTorchMergeProd`](https://mlr3torch.mlr-org.com/reference/mlr_pipeops_nn_merge_prod.md)
or concatenation
([`PipeOpTorchMergeCat`](https://mlr3torch.mlr-org.com/reference/mlr_pipeops_nn_merge_cat.md)).

## Parameters

See the respective child class.

## State

The state is the value calculated by the public method `shapes_out()`.

## Input and Output Channels

`PipeOpTorchMerge`s has either a *vararg* input channel if the
constructor argument `innum` is not set, or input channels `"input1"`,
..., `"input<innum>"`. There is one output channel `"output"`. For an
explanation see
[`PipeOpTorch`](https://mlr3torch.mlr-org.com/reference/mlr_pipeops_torch.md).

## Internals

Per default, the `private$.shapes_out()` method outputs the broadcasted
tensors. There are two things to be aware:

1.  `NA`s are assumed to batch (this should almost always be the batch
    size in the first dimension).

2.  Tensors are expected to have the same number of dimensions, i.e.
    missing dimensions are not filled with 1s. The reason is again that
    the first dimension should be the batch dimension. This private
    method can be overwritten by
    [`PipeOpTorch`](https://mlr3torch.mlr-org.com/reference/mlr_pipeops_torch.md)s
    inheriting from this class.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Method `new()`

Creates a new instance of this
[R6](https://r6.r-lib.org/reference/R6Class.html) class.

#### Usage

    PipeOpTorchMerge$new(
      id,
      module_generator,
      param_set = ps(),
      innum = 0,
      param_vals = list()
    )

#### Arguments

- `id`:

  (`character(1)`)  
  Identifier of the resulting object.

- `module_generator`:

  (`nn_module_generator`)  
  The torch module generator.

- `param_set`:

  ([`ParamSet`](https://paradox.mlr-org.com/reference/ParamSet.html))  
  The parameter set.

- `innum`:

  (`integer(1)`)  
  The number of inputs. Default is 0 which means there is one *vararg*
  input channel.

- `param_vals`:

  ([`list()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/list.html))  
  List of hyperparameter settings, overwriting the hyperparameter
  settings that would otherwise be set during construction.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Method `clone()`

The objects of this class are cloneable with this method.

#### Usage

    PipeOpTorchMerge$clone(deep = FALSE)

#### Arguments

- `deep`:

  Whether to make a deep clone.
