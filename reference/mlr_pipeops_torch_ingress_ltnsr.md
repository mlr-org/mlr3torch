# Ingress for Lazy Tensor

Ingress for a single
[`lazy_tensor`](https://mlr3torch.mlr-org.com/reference/lazy_tensor.md)
column.

## Parameters

- `shape` :: [`integer()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/integer.html) \|
  `NULL` \| `"infer"`  
  The shape of the tensor, where the first dimension (batch) must be
  `NA`. When it is not specified, the lazy tensor input column needs to
  have a known shape. When it is set to `"infer"`, the shape is inferred
  from an example batch.

## Internals

The returned batchgetter materializes the lazy tensor column to a
tensor.

## Input and Output Channels

One input channel called `"input"` and one output channel called
`"output"`. For an explanation see
[`PipeOpTorch`](https://mlr3torch.mlr-org.com/reference/mlr_pipeops_torch.md).

## State

The state is set to the input shape.

### Method `new()`

Creates a new instance of this
[R6](https://r6.r-lib.org/reference/R6Class.html) class.

#### Usage

    PipeOpTorchIngressLazyTensor$new(
      id = "torch_ingress_ltnsr",
      param_vals = list()
    )

#### Arguments
