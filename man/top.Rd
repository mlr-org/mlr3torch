\title{Shorthand TorchOp Constructor}
\usage{
top(.obj, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{.obj}{(\code{character(1)})\cr
The object from which to construct a \code{PipeOp}. If this is a
\code{character(1)}, it is looked up in the \code{\link{mlr_pipeops}} dictionary.
Otherwise, it is converted to a \code{PipeOp}.
It is possible to append a \code{"_[number]"} to the id, to conveniently extract the element
specified by the id without the suffix, while setting giving a different id to the \code{TorchOp}.
[]}

\item{...}{\code{any}\cr
Additional parameters to give to constructed object.
This may be an argument of the constructor of the
\code{TorchOp}, in which case it is given to this constructor;
or it may be a parameter value, in which case it is
given to the \code{param_vals} argument of the constructor.}
}
\description{
Create a \code{TorchOp} from \code{mlr_torchops} from given ID.
The object is initialized with given parameters and \code{param_vals}.
}
\examples{
# these are all equivalent
top("linear", out_features = 10L, id = "linear_1")
top("linear_1", out_features = 10L)
mlr_torchops$get("linear", out_features = 10L, id = "linear_1")
