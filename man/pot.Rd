\title{Convenience Function to Retrieve a PipeOpTorch without the Prefix}
\usage{
pot(.key, ...)

pots(.keys, ...)
}
\description{
Sugar function that allows to construct all \link{PipeOp}s relating to torch without needing to
write out the the prefixes \code{"torch_"} and \code{"nn_"}.
The \code{id} of the resulting object is also without the prefix.

Possible objects to construct are:
\itemize{
\item All objects inheriting from \link{PipeOpTorch}, i.e. \link{PipeOpTorchLinear}, \link{PipeOpTorchReLU}, etc..
\item All objects inheritng from \link{PipeOpTorchIngress} which is the entry point to the network.
\item \link{PipeOpTorchLoss} which allows to configure the loss function.
\item \link{PipeOpTorchOptimizer} which allows to configure the loss Optimizer.
\item All objects inheriting from \link{PipeOpTorchModel} which transforms the \link{ModelDescriptor} into
a torch \link[mlr3:Learner]{mlr3::Learner} and trains it.
}
}
\examples{
po("nn_linear", id = "linear")
# is the same as
pot("linear")

po("torch_optimizer", "adam", id = "adam")
# is the same as
pot("optimizer", "adam")

}
