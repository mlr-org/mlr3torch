nn_graph()
}
\description{
NOTE: Don't use this directly but build it using \link{TorchOp}s.

Neural networks can be represented as Graphs as defined in \link{mlr3pipelines}.
The nodes define the operations that are being applied to the data, and the edges define
the data-flow.
An graph network essentially consists of a list of \code{nn_module}s

\examples{
\dontrun{
# define a graph that represents a skip-connection
graph = top("input") \%>>\%
  gunion(
    list(
      top("linear_1", out_features = 10L) \%>>\% top("relu"),
      top("linear_2")
    )
  ) \%>>\%
  top("add") \%>>\%
  top("output")

graph$plot()
